# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a custom n8n community node that integrates with the fillpdf Python library to enable automated PDF form filling within n8n workflows. The node will allow users to take PDF forms with fillable fields and populate them with data from their n8n workflow, making it easy to generate completed forms, contracts, applications, and other documents programmatically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an n8n workflow designer, I want to fill PDF forms with data from my workflow, so that I can automate document generation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a PDF file with fillable fields THEN the system SHALL identify and list all available form fields
2. WHEN a user maps workflow data to PDF form fields THEN the system SHALL populate those fields with the provided values
3. WHEN the PDF filling process completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return the filled PDF as output data
4. IF the provided PDF has no fillable fields THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating no fields were found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an n8n workflow designer, I want to handle different types of PDF form fields, so that I can work with various PDF documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PDF contains text fields THEN the system SHALL populate them with string values
2. WHEN the PDF contains checkbox fields THEN the system SHALL accept boolean values to check/uncheck them
3. WHEN the PDF contains radio button fields THEN the system SHALL accept string values to select the appropriate option
4. WHEN the PDF contains dropdown fields THEN the system SHALL accept string values to select from available options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an n8n workflow designer, I want to configure the node easily, so that I can set up PDF filling without complex technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the node configuration THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive interface for uploading or referencing PDF files
2. WHEN a user selects a PDF file THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and display available form fields
3. WHEN configuring field mappings THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown menus or input fields for each detected PDF field
4. WHEN saving the configuration THEN the system SHALL validate that all required mappings are properly set

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an n8n workflow designer, I want the node to handle errors gracefully, so that my workflows don't break when PDF processing fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PDF file is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message
2. WHEN fillpdf processing fails THEN the system SHALL capture the error and provide meaningful feedback
3. WHEN required form fields are not provided THEN the system SHALL list the missing fields in the error message
4. WHEN the Python environment or fillpdf library is not available THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an n8n workflow designer, I want to output the filled PDF in different ways, so that I can integrate it with various downstream processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF filling completes THEN the system SHALL provide the filled PDF as binary data
2. WHEN configured to save to file THEN the system SHALL save the filled PDF to a specified path
3. WHEN multiple items are processed THEN the system SHALL handle batch processing of multiple PDFs
4. WHEN outputting results THEN the system SHALL include metadata about the processing (field count, success status, etc.)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the node to follow n8n community node standards, so that it integrates seamlessly with the n8n ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is installed THEN it SHALL appear in the n8n node palette under an appropriate category
2. WHEN the node executes THEN it SHALL follow n8n's data structure conventions for input and output
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use n8n's standard error handling mechanisms
4. WHEN the node is packaged THEN it SHALL include proper metadata, documentation, and installation instructions
